Introduction
============

Available for Windows, Mac OS X, and various Linux distributions, the ownCloud 
Desktop Sync client enables you to:

- Specify one or more directories on your computer that you want to synchronize
  to the ownCloud server.
- Always have the latest files synchronized, wherever they are located.

Your files are always automatically synchronized between your ownCloud server 
and local PC.

.. note:: Because of various technical issues, desktop sync clients older than 
   1.7 will not allowed to connect and sync with the ownCloud 8.1 server. It is 
   highly recommended to keep your client updated.
