* Get patches on github upstreamed, ping Klaas after vacation
* add folder: check for both, local and remote folder if exists
* Rename everything in the UI to Synchronization instead of owncloud

* preprend "Favorites" page with Pictures, Videos, Documents, Music pathes and checkboxen
  -> shortcut to same-named remote folders
  * pre-fill user name from settings, password?
* Settings page, with
  * slider-ish widget for polling interval
  * remote version information

* "Special" ownCloud folder, with metadata config therein, hidden in UI or
  shown with special cased delegate in folder list

* try switching to KIO::NAM, setter for owncloudInfo needed, testing
  needed (will csync go through NAM as well, does it matter to csync?)

* Investigate switching to KConfig & KWallet, ditching MirallConfigFile more or less

* Mechanism for adding Akonadi agents (from webaccounts?)
  * Calendar setup
  * Contacts setup
  * Monitoring akonadi sync

* VCS plugin

* Bookmarks
  * Rekonq
  * Firefox
  * Chrome




Sync:
* investigate polling with the goal to kill it for local folders
* retrieve list of remote folders in Mirall::ownCloudInfo
* Set and test KIO::NetworkAccessManager

Ideas
* loadable profiles, essentially folder configs with enabled / disabled, polling interval

o == done; * == todo


Testing:

= First use =

* delete ~/.local/share/data/Mirall
* restart owncloudsyncd
* Login page, leading to favorites after login
  - error message when credentials are wrong?
  - show favorites when logged in
    1 local folder does not exist, remote folder exists
    2 remote folder exists, local folder doesn't
    3 both local and remote don't exist
    4 both local and remote exist and are not empty


Test setup:
- Documents: 5 Local files, empty remote
- Music: local empty, remote has 5 files
- InstantUpload: local doesn't exist, remote has photos
